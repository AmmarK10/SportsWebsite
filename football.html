            <p>The rules of football are governed by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which outlines 17 official laws of the game. A standard match lasts 90 minutes, split into two halves of 45 minutes, with a 15-minute halftime break. The objective is simple: score more goals than the opponent by getting the ball into the opposing net. Players use their feet, head, and body—except for the goalkeeper, who can use hands within the penalty area. Key rules include offside, fouls, free kicks, penalties, and red/yellow cards for misconduct. The game begins with a kickoff and continues until the final whistle, with added injury time if needed. Football's structure allows for various formats, from local leagues to international competitions, each governed by tactical formations, player roles, and coaching strategies.</p>
