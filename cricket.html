            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport that originated in England and has grown into one of the most popular games worldwide, especially in countries like India, Australia, Pakistan, and South Africa. Played between two teams of eleven players each, cricket is more than just a game—it’s a cultural phenomenon that brings people together across continents. The sport is played in various formats, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20), each offering a unique blend of strategy, endurance, and excitement.

            <p>The rules of cricket are governed by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and include 15 core laws that ensure fair play. The game begins with a toss to decide which team bats or bowls first. The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two wickets, while the bowling team tries to dismiss batters through methods like bowled, caught, or run out. Each innings consists of a set number of overs—six legal balls per over—and the team with the most runs at the end wins. Fielding positions, pitch dimensions, and equipment like the cricket bat and ball are all standardized. Formats differ in duration: Test matches last up to five days, ODIs are 50 overs per side, and T20s are 20 overs per side, making the game accessible to both purists and casual fans.
